# Doubly Linked List vs Array List Implementation

## Project Description
This project demonstrates two implementations of a character list in Python:
1. **Doubly Linked List** - Custom pointer-based implementation
2. **Array List** - Implementation using Python's built-in lists

The implementations provide identical functionality while showcasing different approaches to data structure design.

## Variant Information
**Variant 21 Requirements:**
- Initial implementation: Doubly Linked List
- Refactored implementation: Array-based List
- Elements must be single characters (Python strings of length 1)

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Git

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/list-implementations.git
cd list-implementations
